For some reason I've always been a bit of a contrarian. Being brought up religiously and then escaping that religion kind of does that to you,  I guess. As a kid I read all the spy-tech and detective skills books I could get my hand on. That was a long time ago, but this itch in the back of mind is still there. I loved covert, stealthy stuff. And now that I'm older, I still do. But now I look at things from the perspective of power and technology.
