Whenever I open my youtube feed, I get these "how to get into cybersecurity" video's, which offer their courses or some kind of six-week bootcamp. "Just follow these steps and within 30 days you too can have a six-figure job." - I call bullshit.

Bleach your brain, and remember only this;

Aggressively and obsessively follow your curiosity. The rest will follow.

That's it. It may not be solid life advice, but it's what consistently breeds good *anything*. If your curiosity even slightly aligns with one or more of the subsets in the field of infosec, you're golden.

There are enough podcasts, courses and MOOC's to get to where you want to go. Just stick to the cycle: Learn, get your hands dirty with what you just learnt and then ask questions about what you just did.

Or the TLDR; Eat, sleep, hack, repeat.

I'm only half joking. From what I remember about the 1990's, the hacker community seemed to me like it was gatekept by elitist snobs who tried to ward of pimply-faced teens like myself by using platitudes.

The response to my question of "*how do I learn how to hack?*" was simple and effective - "*Be curious, learn a unix-based operating system, learn to create programs in C and then learn how to break your own programs. Then, eventually, you can break other people's programs as well. But most of all, be curious".

"*Be curious*".  Now, more than 20 years later, this resonates most of all. It really is the foundation. And this hasn't changed.
