There’s something strangely grounding about admitting you don’t know everything — especially when you’ve spent decades building, breaking, and rebuilding systems.

I don’t walk into rooms thinking I’m the senior. But I leave most engagements quietly realizing I was. Not because I sought that title, but because the baseline knowledge I carry — TCP/IP, filesystem permissions, packet inspection, the old rituals — seems to be disappearing. Replaced by abstractions. Paved over by platforms.

Sometimes it feels like I’m the last person at the party still reading the manual.

Maybe that makes me a grumpy old sysadmin shaking his fist at the cloud: “Learn TCP/IP before spinning up Kubernetes!” Maybe. But I’d rather be grounded than drift with the marketing wind.

So I decided to turn that energy inward. To sharpen the blade again. Not with another DevOps gig or by tuning YAML for the hundredth time, but by returning to something raw.

## Hack The Box

I’d had an account for a while — like most tech folks, I registered out of curiosity, poked a few menus, and then forgot about it. But this time, I committed. If I was going to move from builder to breaker, I’d need a proving ground. HTB seemed like the right kind of arena.

They noticed I was a first-timer and dropped me into a tour — a curated path, presented in three batches, through some of the “Very Easy” boxes. Not a challenge, per se. More like a memory test. A handshake with the fundamentals.

Batch 1: The key is a strong foundation

2. [fawn](/posts/htb-fawn "fawn")
3. [dancing](/posts/htb-dancing "dancing")
4. [redeemer](/posts/htb-redeemer "redeemer")
5. [explosion](/posts/htb-explosion "explosion")
6. [preignition](/posts/htb-preignition "preignition")
7. [mongod](/posts/htb-mongod "mongod")
8. [synced](/posts/htb-sync "sync")

Straightforward — but revealing. They weren’t hard. But then again, they weren’t supposed to be.

## What I Took From It

These were signals. Echoes from a time when we debugged login forms by hand and cracked services because we understood their default behavior.

It was nostalgic. And clarifying.

For someone who wandered too deep into DevOps — into the realm of Terraform loops and CI failure chains — these boxes felt like a return to roots. To real systems. To real thinking.

There’s something pure about it. You against a machine. No orchestration layers, no feature flags, no “this only fails in production.” Just an IP, a port, and the quiet question: what can I do with this?
