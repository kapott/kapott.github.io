## One step at a time..

I don't like assuming I know it all. I do know I'm a senior in "IT stuff". Not because I feel like I am, but mostly because of the people around me I meet with every engagement and gig who seem to _not_ know a lot of the stuff I consider _basic knowledge_ in the industry.

But then again, I might just be a grumpy old fart shaking his fist at the cloud, yelling "learn tcp/ip before you try to set up cloud infrastructure!".

I digress. Hack the box seemed like a good place to start. I've had the account for a while, but never really did anything with it. Let's change that. 

Usually you just have to submit the user and root flags and you'll get rewarded for a box. But because I didn't do any boxes yet, they laid out a tour for me. The tour consists of some tutorial-like boxes you have to own - labeled "very easy". Let's take the tour.

The boxes
1. [meow](/posts/htb-meow "meow")
2. [fawn](/posts/htb-fawn "fawn")
3. [dancing](/posts/htb-dancing "dancing")
4. [redeemer](/posts/htb-redeemer "redeemer")
5. [explosion](/posts/htb-explosion "explosion")
6. [preignition](/posts/htb-preignition "preignition")
7. [mongod](/posts/htb-mongod "mongod")
8. [synced](/posts/htb-synced "synced")

## Conclusion

These really did feel like a "remember these things?" boxes moreso than a challenge. A good starting point for someone who wandered into the "yaml simulator" realm of devops a few years ago.
