## Entrepreneur

I’ve always been drawn to building things — especially when those things help people.

Somewhere along the way, I realized that solving real problems is not only satisfying, but also sustainable. That’s how I approach entrepreneurship: not as a hustle, but as applied curiosity. I follow a few timeless principles:

- Keep it simple. Complexity fails silently.  
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped.  
- Every complex system begins as a simple one that worked.  
- Build tools that solve one thing. Solve it well.  

I’m not linking past projects here — partly for privacy, partly because this isn’t about what I’ve done. It’s about how I think.

## Software Developer

I didn’t become a developer because I loved typing code. I became a developer because I love solving problems and building systems that live beyond me.

Languages are just tools. They’re not religions — they’re chosen based on context:

- If I need output speed:  
  → JavaScript (Next.js, Node), Python (Flask/Django), Golang  
- If I need scalability and handoff:  
  → Java (Spring), Python (Django)  
- If I want to have fun:  
  → Haskell, Rust, or bare-bones C

Ultimately, I write code to express intent — and to design leverage.

## Hacker

I use the term carefully — not for bravado, but for orientation.

I like finding the seams in things. Network misconfigurations, exposed endpoints, misbehaving systems. Anything that feels off tends to pull at my attention until I understand *why*.

Platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe scratch the same itch as puzzles do — except they add the thrill of exploration. Bug bounties give me permission to poke around without the legal gray area. And when I’m in that zone — head down, tunnel vision, tracing threads through stack traces or headers — that’s when I feel most at home.

---

## Puzzles

I don’t solve puzzles for fun. I solve them because I don’t know how *not* to.

Pattern recognition, domain fluency, lateral movement — it’s all a dance of abstraction and execution. Puzzles aren’t limited to Rubik’s cubes or Sudoku. They exist in broken APIs, misrouted traffic, business models, even human systems.

To solve them, I work backwards. What knowledge does this problem demand? What am I missing? Then I go learn it. That’s how I’ve picked up enough physics, biology, math, chemistry, and systems thinking to build a web of “know enough to figure it out.”

## Tech

When I talk about “tech,” I don’t mean gadgets. I mean augmentation.

Technology — real technology — expands human potential. We’re already cyborgs in a very real sense. The interface is different from what science fiction promised, but the merge has already happened. Our phones hold our memories. Our systems guide our thoughts. Our networks shape our beliefs.

Understanding how those systems work — and where they can be improved or abused — feels like a civic duty.

---

## Futurism

The future isn’t linear. It arrives unevenly, often unnoticed.

I think about trajectories. What happens when compute becomes ambient? When privacy disappears by default? When AI agents negotiate our decisions before we make them?

I don’t pretend to have the answers. But I do enjoy standing on the edge and squinting into the fog.

---

## Father

This is the real grounding force. My kids remind me daily that not everything needs to be optimized. That curiosity is contagious. That simplicity is a feature, not a bug.

Being a father informs how I think about risk, time, legacy, and joy. It also makes everything more real.

## Neurodivergent

ADHD and autism aren’t just labels — they’re operating systems.

I think in patterns, not timelines. I hyperfocus. I forget small things and solve big ones. I need solitude to think, but can speak fluently in diagrams.

The older I get, the more I realize: this is a feature, not a flaw. I build systems that work *with* the way my brain is wired — and they tend to be useful for others, too.
