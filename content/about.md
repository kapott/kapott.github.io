# About Me

I build things. Usually software, sometimes companies. This is who I am and how I work.

## Entrepreneur

I start [micro-ISV's](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/01/11/micro-isv-from-vision-to-reality-2/) because I see problems that need solving. Not from abstract business plans, but because something isn't working and could work better.

My approach is pragmatic. I look for working solutions, not perfect ones. What matters is whether people actually benefit from it. A good product solves one problem and does it thoroughly. Complexity is a luxury you can only afford once the basics are solid.

I don't link previous projects here. Partly for privacy, partly because it's irrelevant. What I've made says less than how I think.

## Software Developer

I write code because it's the most efficient way to turn an idea into reality.

Languages are tools. I choose them based on what's needed, not what's popular. 
- For quick prototypes I use JavaScript (Specifivally Nextjs) or Python with Flask.
- For systems that need to scale and be maintained by others: Java with Spring or Python with Django.
- For performance-critical components: Rust or Golang.
- For fun and mental gymnastics: Haskell or C.

Code is a means. The goal is to build something that works and keeps working after I'm gone.

## Hacker

I use this word deliberately. It's not about breaking in, but about understanding how systems actually work.
I look for weak spots. Not to exploit them, but because they show me where the assumptions are. 

Every system has assumptions. Those assumptions are interesting.

I use platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe to keep that skill sharp. Bug bounties give me a legal way to poke at other people's infrastructure without lawyers getting involved.

When I'm working on a technical problem, the world around me disappears. I follow threads through logs, headers, stack traces until I understand why something fails. That's when I feel most comfortable.


---

## Puzzles

I solve puzzles because I can't stop until I have the answer.
It doesn't matter if it's Rubik's cubes, broken APIs, bad routing, or a poorly designed process. If there's a pattern and it doesn't add up, I need to know why.

I work backwards. What do I need to know to solve this? What knowledge am I missing? Then I go learn it. 

That's how I've picked up enough physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics to navigate different domains. Not everything in depth, but enough to ask the right questions.

## Tech

Technology is human extension. We're already cyborgs, it just looks different than in the movies.

Our memory lives in our phones. Our navigation is outsourced to GPS. Our communication runs through systems we don't own. That's not criticism, that's observation.

Understanding how those systems work—and where they fail—feels like a responsibility. Not everyone needs to know how a database works, but someone has to know. I'm happy to be one of those someones.

---

## Futurism

The future doesn't arrive linearly. It shows up in fragments, in places you don't expect.

I think about what happens when compute is everywhere. When privacy becomes the exception instead of the default. When AI systems make decisions before we think about them.
I don't have answers. But I think it's important to ask these questions.

---

## Father

This is what keeps me grounded. My kids show me daily that not everything needs to be more efficient. 

That curiosity is contagious. 

That simple is sometimes better than clever.

Being a father changes how I look at risk, at time, at what I leave behind. It makes everything more real.

## Neurodivergent

ADHD and autism are part of my operating system. Getting diagnosed, and educated about it, was like getting a user manual on your own operating system.

I can focus on one thing for hours and forget to eat.
 
I need silence and time to think, but can explain fluently through diagrams.

The older I get, the clearer it becomes: this isn't a bug. It's how I work. 
I build systems that fit how my brain functions. And usually those work for others too.
